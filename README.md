A project to support data driven decision when selecting my Fantasy Premier League Team.

I processed the data with SQL and placed it into the data/processed_data folder
'squad-selector': builds a predictive model for a players points in a season, the uses an optimiser to select my squad
'transfers': used to find alternate players fitting with constraints to replace players in my squad
